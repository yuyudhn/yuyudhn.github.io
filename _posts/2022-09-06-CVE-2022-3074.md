## Introduction
Receiving an assigned CVE ID is something new to me. Seeing other people with their own CVEs makes me feel that they are cool. So, I have decided to begin hunting for vulnerabilities within the WordPress ecosystem. As a starting point, I am hunting for a vulnerability in a WordPress plugin and have reported it through WPScan, an authorized Certified Numbering Authority (CNA) that can assign a CVE number to a vulnerability.

CVE-2022-3074 is my first ever CVE. I would like to give a special shoutout to [**Rafshanzani Suhada**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rafsanzani-suhada99) for helping me discover my first CVE and providing guidance on how to report it through WPScan.

## Description
There isn't any complexity or requirement for high skills to find this CVE. Actually, it's a low-hanging fruit bugâ€”a **stored XSS** vulnerability that requires **Administrator** privileges. What makes it special, once again, is that it's my first-ever CVE.

## Proof of Concept
Create or edit a Slide and put the following payload in the Name field: 
```javascript
" onfocus=alert(/XSS/) autofocus="
```
The XSS will be triggered upon editing the slide again.

This vulnerability affects **Slider Hero** versions up to 8.4.3 and has been resolved in version **8.4.4**.
