This article is a recap of my accomplishments this year. It highlights what I've done and sets the stage for my goals next year.

## February 2023: Passed OSCP
I'm hesitant about taking the OSCP exam and, to be honest, I never feel fully prepared for it. Especially since I lacked any prior experience in Active Directory exploitation. However, my company insists it's my turn since other colleagues have already taken (and passed) the OSCP. 

After studying the PEN-200 course and labs for two months, I decided to take the exam, even though I didn't feel completely prepared for it. Though I couldn't gain root access to one particular machine and only managed to obtain user access, I still successfully [passed the OSCP](https://www.credential.net/f7c4fe1a-63b2-4cb5-b590-846754cbf9f4). This experience reinforces that I've truly embraced the 'try harder' mindset.

## April 2023: Passed CRTO
I felt rushed before taking the OSCP and realized I had skipped some fundamentals in AD exploitation. To solidify my knowledge, I decided to go 'back to basics' and thoroughly relearn Active Directory exploitation. After gaining confidence in my skills, I took the CRTO exam and successfully [passed](https://eu.badgr.com/public/assertions/N-ZkSCLeTvm-b3RovW7o0Q).

## April 2023: Passed EWPTX
After passing the OSCP, I enrolled in the EWPTX course offered by INE Security (formerly eLearn Security). I feel more confident about this certification because I have over three years of professional-level experience in web pentesting, unlike my initial experience with OSCP. 

After completing the exam and submitting the report, I had to wait for about a month to receive notification that I had [passed the EWPTX](https://www.credential.net/c2647beb-d312-4ddc-8daa-08c16af8ea8f).

## Semptember 2023: Passed CRTA
CyberWarFare Labs recently released a new certification, CRTA, and offered a discounted price of only $50. Recognizing it as a beginner-friendly certification for those interested in Active Directory exploitation, I decided to give it a try. As expected, I successfully [passed the CRTA](https://www.credential.net/691ec8db-0417-42cf-8aa1-3e0067f50583) exam.

## November 2023: Passed CRTP
Now that I feel confident in Active Directory exploitation, I've decided to progress further on my red teaming journey by taking the CRTP exam. 

After completing the exam, I waited about a week to receive notification that I had [passed](https://www.credential.net/efdf4d11-05f1-4100-8437-725f2c0a0a2d). CRTP marks the final certification I pursued this year.


## Other Achievement: Obtained 100+ CVEs
In early 2023, my objective was to achieve 100 CVEs. Concurrently, I embarked on research endeavors within open-source projects, primarily delving into [WordPress](https://patchstack.com/database/researcher/426e9e37-bebb-4441-8a9f-81d1de9859f2) plugins. This exploration broadened my understanding and engagement in the cybersecurity landscape.

## Next Year Target
Next year, my goal is to pursue CRTE. However, I plan to prepare by first taking ECPPT and PNPT, viewing them as beneficial steps towards achieving my objective.

Update: Just passed my eCPPT, but seriously, [don't take any INE certification in the moment](https://www.linuxsec.org/2024/02/review-ecppt.html).

Update 2: Instead of pursuing CRTE, I took and passed the OSEP exam. I plan to skip CRTE and take the CARTP exam next year.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, I've accomplished numerous achievements this year. I'm grateful and say 'Alhamdulillah.' Thank you, 2023, for the opportunities and experiences.
