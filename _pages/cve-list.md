## The Beginning
I started my journey in CVE hunting in late 2022. My friend **Rafshanzani Suhada** introduced me to how to report a WordPress plugin vulnerability to WPScan. And then, [CVE-2022-3074 ](https://yuyudhn.github.io/CVE-2022-3074/)became my first-ever CVE.

After my first CVE was published, I conducted some research on open-source projects on GitHub and discovered a Host Header Injection vulnerability in Feehi CMS, which was assigned [CVE-2022-38796](https://yuyudhn.github.io/CVE-2022-38796/).

## Massive Hunt at 2023
In 2023, I conducted a massive hunt on WordPress plugins, creating a bot to detect vulnerabilities in them, and then reported the issues through [Patchstack](https://patchstack.com/database/researcher/426e9e37-bebb-4441-8a9f-81d1de9859f2). During that year, I obtained more than 100 CVEs.

This is some CVE i found in 2023.
