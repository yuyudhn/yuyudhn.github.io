## Whoami
I work as a **Cyber Security Consultant** and I am passionate about cybersecurity, GNU/Linux, and open source technologies. I've been using Debian as my primary operating system since 2013. I'm also a fan of "Evangelion" and "My Hero Academia". Additionally, I am a huge admirer of the GOAT, [Cristiano Ronaldo](https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo).

Learn hacking through the underground forum [**HN Community**](https://web.archive.org/web/20120101160329/http://hacker-newbie.org/), which is the largest Indonesian hacker newbie community.

## Professional Certification

- OffSec Experienced Penetration Tester (OSEP)
- OffSec Certified Professional (OSCP)
- Certified Red Team Professional (CRTP)
- Practical Network Penetration Tester (PNPT)
- Certified Professional Penetration Tester (eCPPT)
- Certified Red Team Operator (CRTO)
- Web Application Penetration Tester Extreme (eWPTX)

## Community
Since almost all of the skills I possess were self-taught, I also have to actively participate in internet forums to continue to grow. Currently, I am active in the [IndoXploit](https://github.com/indoxploit-coders) and [ZeroByte.ID](https://github.com/zerobyte-id) communities.

I also write articles about Cybersecurity, GNU/Linux, and Open source on [LinuxSec](https://www.linuxsec.org/) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@yuyudhn).

## Cybersecurity Playground
For brainstorming, amidst my busy schedule of performing application pentest for clients, I work on some machines on HackTheBox and also on TryHackMe.

## Open Source Project
I contribute to the Open Source world, particularly in the scope of Cybersecurity. Some projects that I have created or documented can be accessed on my [Github](https://github.com/yuyudhn).

## CVE Project
I also contribute to secure open-source projects by reporting vulnerability that I find and identifying them with CVE ID. For some of the CVEs that I have discovered, you can see them on this blog post under the [CVE](/cve-list/) page.
